RAG System: Leave No Context Behind
Introduction
Welcome to the RAG System repository, where we introduce a novel approach to contextual understanding as outlined in our paper "Leave No Context Behind". The RAG System incorporates the power of Open API and the Gemini Pro model, complemented by a user-friendly frontend developed using Streamlit.

About the Paper
"Leave No Context Behind" serves as a comprehensive guide to the RAG System, highlighting its utilization of Open API and Gemini Pro for enhanced contextual analysis. This paper elucidates the system's methodology and its significance in the realm of information processing.

Features
Open API Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Open API to access diverse data sources and enhance contextual comprehension.
Gemini Pro Model: Leverages the advanced capabilities of the Gemini Pro model for in-depth analysis and interpretation.
Streamlit Frontend: Employs Streamlit to create an intuitive and interactive user interface for seamless navigation and exploration.
